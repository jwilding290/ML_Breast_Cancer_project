## Objective

The purpose of the course project is to apply machine learning techniques on a problem of your own choosing using Python and the Scikit-Learn module. The project will be hands-on and it will require you to select appropriate performance metrics for your problem and also properly compare performance of different methods. You will also gain experience on documenting your findings and your code in a Jupyter Notebook environment. In addition, you will get the opportunity to receive feedback on your performance and the report that you submit.

## Skills Learned

- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learing
- Scikit-learn module

## About Project

The Project was done in two phases.

### Phase 1

Data pre-processing (dealing with missing values, dropping ID-like columns, data aggregation, etc.) as appropriate.

Data exploration and visualisation (charts, graphs, interactions, etc) as appropriate.

### Phase 2

Predictive modeling as appropriate.
